# Heygo coding challenge

### Please refer to Question.md for Part 1

### Languages
React 17.0.2
Typescript 4.3.2

### Setup
Then run the following command to start the development server locally:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

### Technical Notes
1. Incorporated react query for fetching and caching the data
2. At the moment the google map is still in developer mode. Feel free to replace the Google Map api key in the .env file 

### Further Improvement
1. Could store the query in localStorage to persist the status if user revisit the application.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

##### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


##### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

##### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\

##### `npm run eject`

Eject the react bundle
